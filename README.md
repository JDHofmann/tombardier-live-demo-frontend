# Tombardier Frontend

<br>

### *Portfolio Building Made Simple*

---

<br>

Tombardier is a browser based portfolio builder for developers to quickly build and deploy a personal site

Built with a Ruby on Rails API backend, and a React/Redux front-end(this file) for Flatiron School Software Engineering Program

Check out the **[Live Demo](https://tombardier.netlify.app/)** to try it out.

<br>


**This repo is built to run on it's companion [backend]() so I recommend setting that up first.**

## Getting Started

<br>


Fork and clone this repo, and run

`npm install`

<br>

---

<br>

## Running Locally

<br>

At this point you should have your backend up and running locally
If your Rails server is working fine, the first key value pair should be **id: 1**

If the id is different from that, possibly from reseeding the file a few times, copy the id number and open ***actions.js*** inside *src/redux* and change **line 1** to the new id number

`const userId = *newIdeaNumberHere*`
<br>

<br>
`npm start`
